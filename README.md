# Language-Detection-SoC-Resources


# WEEK --1

Mentees  are advised to create a GitHub account so that u can later create repositories for the our major task language detection to maintain your code & analysis (in the form of ipython notebooks) there.
I'm not sure if most of you are familiar with Google Colab or not, but if not, it basically allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with zero configuration required, free access to GPUs & easy sharing. You can find more information about it here:

1. Python Resource--
   https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/tree/master/Python
   
   This code help you in understanding  the function in python 
   https://github.com/wncc/learners-space/blob/master/Python/Week%202/Notebook1.ipynb
   
   
   
  To revise all this concept or if someone not understand any code , you can watch these videos .

  2.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wlS_fWxIPyQ&list=PLZoTAELRMXVNUL99R4bDlVYsncUNvwUBB&index=5
  
  
  
  
  
  
  Now we will start to learn some basic python libraries which will we help us in  Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.
  
  1. Numpy ---
    resource - Try to watch atleast first 3 videos of this playlist  and also try to code same things by ourself. It will boost up your Confidence.

  2. Pandas--
     As we will use only some basics commands of pandas for our purpose , so i will try to convey about this library by myself. I think that we will be more helpful.
     
     
Here our week 1 finishes . 

Happy Learning .
